## User Story
>As a website user, I want my needs expressed in a story, so that it's simple to understand the action I need to take and why I want to take it.

## Overview
_Write a brief overview of the feature that's being requested. Translate any notes from the client that relate to this task, if necessary. Give the larger context for the request -- how and why it fits into the bigger picture for the client._

## Acceptance Criteria
_This should be all the things that you want to test when the feature is complete._
1. The list should be explicit.
2. The list should include appropriate URLs.
3. The list should be focused on what the feature needs to do, rather than how the feature needs to do it.
4. The list can be simple and high level.

## Helpful links and documents
_Requirements documentation to reference when performing this request. Include links to everything, even if there files or links already elsewhere in Teamwork. Set up the task so that the person acting on it has everything they need in one place. This can frequently just be copied from task to task with minimal edits._
