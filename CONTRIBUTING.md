## Getting started <!-- omit in toc -->

### Before you begin

You wll need a local site setup. Make sure you read the [readme](README.md) for instructions on how to do it.

### Ready to make a change? Create a branch.

Not sure where to start? Here are some hints.

Branch using GitHub Desktop:

- [Getting started with GitHub Desktop](https://docs.github.com/en/desktop/installing-and-configuring-github-desktop/getting-started-with-github-desktop) will guide you through setting up Desktop.
- Once Desktop is set up, you can use it to [branch the repo](https://docs.github.com/en/desktop/contributing-and-collaborating-using-github-desktop/making-changes-in-a-branch)!

Branch using the command line:

- [Branch the repo](https://www.git-tower.com/learn/git/commands/git-branch/) so that you can make your changes without affecting the original project until you're ready to merge them.

### Make your update
Make your changes to the file(s) you'd like to update and/or add new files. Please export and commit any config related to your changes.

### Open a pull request
When you're done making changes and you'd like to propose them for review, use the [pull request template](#pull-request-template) to open your PR (pull request).

### Submit your PR & get it reviewed
- Once you submit your PR, other Kanopians will review it with you. The first thing you're going to want to do is a [self review](#self-review).
- After that, we may have questions, check back on your PR to keep up with the conversation.
- Did you have an issue, like a merge conflict? Check out our [git tutorial](https://lab.github.com/githubtraining/managing-merge-conflicts) on how to resolve merge conflicts and other issues.

### You're done with your mini project!
Congratulations! The whole Kanopi community thanks you for your time. :sparkles:

## Reviewing
We (usually the project tech lead, but sometimes other Kanopi engineers too!) review every single PR. The purpose of reviews is to create the best experience we can for people who use our sites.

:yellow_heart: Reviews are always respectful, acknowledging that everyone did the best possible job with the knowledge they had at the time.  
:yellow_heart: Reviews discuss code, not the person who created it.  
:yellow_heart: Reviews are constructive and start conversation around feedback.  

### Self review
You should always review your own PR first.

For code changes, make sure that you:
- [ ] Confirm that the changes meet the user experience and goals outlined in the provided brief, issue, or task (if there is one).
- [ ] Compare your pull request's source to the main branch to be sure that everything looks as expected. 
- [ ] Make sure your code uses [Drupal coding standards](https://www.drupal.org/docs/develop/standards/coding-standards). The [Coder](https://www.drupal.org/project/coder) module is a good place to start.
- [ ] Make sure your branch is up to date with `main` and resolve any merge conflicts before you request a review.
- [ ] If there are any failing automated checks in your PR, troubleshoot them until they're all passing.

### Pull request template
When you open a pull request, you must fill out the "Ready for review" template before we can review your PR. This template helps reviewers understand your changes and the purpose of your pull request.

### Suggested changes
We may ask for changes to be made before a PR can be approved, either using [suggested changes](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/incorporating-feedback-in-your-pull-request) or pull request comments. You can make any changes, then commit them to your branch.

As you update your PR and apply changes, mark each conversation as [resolved](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/commenting-on-a-pull-request#resolving-conversations).
